   d. Stores all details in MongoDB.
   e. Generates a barcode image (PNG) for each SKU.

5. Required Installations:
   a. Python 3
   b. MongoDB (installed and running on localhost:27017)
   c. Libraries:
    1. pymongo
    2. python-barcode
    3. pillow
    4. reportlab


   Use these commands:
   pip install pymongo
   pip install python-barcode pillow reportlab

6. How to Run:
   a. Start MongoDB server on your computer.
   b. Run the Python file (e.g., python inventory.py).
   c. Enter details as asked (size, sleeve, color, etc.).
   d. The program will:

     2. Generate a barcode PNG file in the same folder.
   e. Barcode file names will be like: 1_tshirt_barcode_gen.png

7. Benefits:
   a. Easy inventory management.
   b. No duplicate SKUs.
   c. Barcode ready for scanning.
   d. Beginners can learn database + barcode generation in one project.

This project is beginner-friendly. You only need to follow the steps carefully. Even if you are not from a coding background, you can run it with little effort.\
